Stanford CoreNLP includes [SUTime](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sutime.html), Stanford's temporal expression
recognizer. SUTime is transparently called from the "ner" annotator,
so no configuration is necessary. Furthermore, the "cleanxml"
annotator now extracts the reference date for a given XML document, so
relative dates, e.g., "yesterday", are transparently normalized with
no configuration necessary.

SUTime supports the same annotations as before, i.e.,
NamedEntityTagAnnotation is set with the label of the numeric entity (DATE,
TIME, DURATION, MONEY, PERCENT, or NUMBER) and
NormalizedNamedEntityTagAnnotation is set to the value of the normalized
temporal expression. Note that NormalizedNamedEntityTagAnnotation now
follows the TIMEX3 standard, rather than Stanford's internal representation,
e.g., "2010-01-01" for the string "January 1, 2010", rather than "20100101".

Also, SUTime now sets the TimexAnnotation key to an
edu.stanford.nlp.time.Timex object, which contains the complete list of
TIMEX3 fields for the corresponding expressions, such as "val", "alt_val",
"type", "tid". This might be useful to developers interested in recovering
complete TIMEX3 expressions.

Reference dates are by default extracted from the "datetime" and
"date" tags in an xml document.  To set a different set of tags to
use, use the clean.datetags property.  When using the API, reference
dates can be added to an `Annotation` via
`edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations.DocDateAnnotation`,
although note that when processing an xml document, the cleanxml
annotator will overwrite the `DocDateAnnotation` if
"datetime" or "date" are specified in the document.

Recently some options have been added to `ner` to allow for specifying
document date at the command line.  The `ner.usePresentDateForDocDate` option
will give documents the current date as the doc date.  The `ner.providedDocDate`
option will use the provided date for doc date.  The date format should be `yy-mm-dd`.
